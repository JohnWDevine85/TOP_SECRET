So the idea for now at least is to create these achievements and display them on a page.  Similar to how steam has them listed when comparing to other’s stats, show a percentage of the class that’s done any of these.

Something like this maybe?

Feel free to add anything you want

Achievement Page:

Navbar-----------------------------------------------------

		Line 1	[Text] Iron Coder : Complete a daily project
		Line 2	[Image]—————||||||||| 80% [Image]
		Line 3 	[Text](list of names from the class?)
-----------------------------------------------------

A page with a generic letter to everyone/instructors just saying thanks for all the fish, basically:

Navbar-----------------------------------------------------

                      Title
       Thanks for everything! etc with longer text
-----------------------------------------------------       

A leaderboard page showing some ping-pong scores:

                      Hi-Scores:

A page with everyone's name and a place to leave a message if you want to:
